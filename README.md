# GeoRiskPredict
A geo-location based dataset generator with safety logic (for age, sex, time, location)

This project aims to analyze and classify areas of Morocco based on risk levels, time, and victim profiles. It generates synthetic data for various locations and simulates danger prediction using logical rules or machine learning.

üó∫Ô∏è Features:
- Time-based and age/gender-sensitive danger detection
- Location-specific analysis (e.g. parks, mosques, public spaces)
- Daily updates with realistic synthetic data

This project is part of a broader study on urban safety using AI tools.
